CLEAR RATIONALE FOR PRICING at the time of launch of a new medicine
LIMITED U.S. PRICE INCREASES on our medicines over time

When we set the price of a new medicine, we hold ourselves to a rigorous and structured process that includes a holistic assessment of value, including 1) clinical value and outcomes, or the benefit the medicine delivers to patients, and how well it works compared to a standard of care; 2) economic value, or how the medicine reduces the need  and therefore costs  of other health care interventions; and 3) social value, or how the medicine contributes to quality of life and productivity.

We acknowledge our role in preserving the sustainability of our health care system and in limiting our contribution to U.S. health care spending growth.

We acknowledge our role in preserving the sustainability of our health care system and in limiting our contribution to U.S. health care spending growth. Should we take a list price increase on one of our medicines, our guiding principle is to limit the total annual increase during our fiscal year (Jan. 1 to Dec. 31) to a level at or below the projected growth rate for National Health Expenditures (NHE) for said year.   Our benchmark, the projected U.S. NHE growth rate, is estimated and published annually by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The NHE projection provides a critical forward-looking view needed for business planning. NHE measures spending across all health care goods and services and reflects payments made by both public and private payors. Once the NHE projection is updated each year, we will adjust any future planned pricing actions to reflect the projection. Given the need for business planning, we will adopt the updated standard by April 1 each year.",,See Column 10 Cost Increase Factors,,,,,,,,,,,,

For our part, we price our medicines according to their value, while contributing to broader solutions that improve patient outcomes and support affordability within the U.S. health care system.
Sanofis commitment to pricing rests on three principles:
 CLEAR RATIONALE FOR PRICING at the time of launch of a new medicine
 LIMITED U.S. PRICE INCREASES on our medicines over time
 CONTINUED TRANSPARENCY IN THE U.S. around our pricing decisions
When we set the price of a new medicine, we hold ourselves to a rigorous and structured process that includes a holistic assessment of value, including 1) clinical value and outcomes, or the benefit the medicine delivers to patients, and how well it works compared to a standard of care; 2) economic value, or how the medicine reduces the need  and therefore costs  of other health care interventions; and 3) social value, or how the medicine contributes to quality of life and productivity. Our assessments rely on a range of internal and external methodologies, including health technology assessment (HTA) and other analyses that help define or quantify value and include patient perspectives and priorities. Similar treatment options available or anticipated at the time of launch, in order to understand the landscape within the disease areas in which the medicine may be used. Affordability, including the steps we must take to promote access for patients and contribute to a more sustainable system for payors and health care systems. Unique factors specific to the medicine at the time of launch.
