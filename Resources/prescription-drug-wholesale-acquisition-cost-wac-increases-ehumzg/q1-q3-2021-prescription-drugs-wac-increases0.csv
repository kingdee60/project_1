That mission, however, entails tremendous risk of failure and research and development costs that total in the billions of dollars.  At the present time, CABOMETYX® and COMETRIQ®, both derived from the same molecule, cabozantinib, are the only products that Exelixis sells and comprise the vast majority of Exelixis’ revenue.  Exelixis is committed to spending the largest portion of this revenue on drug discovery research and clinical development, and to pricing CABOMETYX consistent with its value when compared to competitive products approved for similar conditions. 
Drug Discovery and Development Factors: Having recently constructed new laboratory facilities, Exelixis re-launched its drug discovery activities in 2018 and is working to discover the next generation of cancer therapies.  As part of these efforts, Exelixis has advanced three candidates to Phase 1 clinical trials, and anticipates filing INDs for up to two additional candidates in 2021.  Exelixis considered the investments necessary to undertake and support these drug discovery and development efforts when it contemplated changes to CABOMETYX’s wholesale acquisition cost.
Cabozantinib Development Factors:  Since the initial commercial launch of cabozantinib, Exelixis has received extensive additional data demonstrating that cabozantinib shows activity in an extremely broad and diverse collection of additional cancers.  Alone and in combination with other therapies, it is currently being studied in over 100 clinical trials for over 20 different forms of cancer.  Exelixis considered the cost of this clinical development program, and the need to expand it to reach cabozantinib’s full potential for treating the largest number of cancer patients, when it contemplated changes to the wholesale acquisition cost of CABOMETYX. 
CABOMETYX Value Factors:  CABOMETYX has been approved by the FDA to treat patients with liver and kidney cancer, including a recent approval for the  treatment of 1st line kidney cancer in combination with nivolumab, and has shown impressive efficacy relative to its competitors in treating patients with these life-threatening diseases.  It is the only drug of its kind to improve overall survival in a statistically significant manner in both kidney and liver cancer.  When Exelixis contemplated a change to the wholesale acquisition cost for CABOMETYX, Exelixis considered the clinical value proposition of CABOMETYX relative to its competitor prescription drugs, as well as the competitive market generally and the existing price points of competitors.
CABOMETYX Cost Factors:  At Exelixis, we are committed to ensuring that all patients in need can access our medicines.  To secure that the supply of CABOMETYX for our customers, and ultimately, patients is safe and interrupted, Exelixis has expanded its supply chain network, establishing redundancies to prevent supply disruption.  In addition, Exelixis has and continues to incur increasing costs in manufacturing due to volatility in the cost of raw materials and other inputs.  When Exelixis contemplated changes to the wholesale acquisition cost of CABOMETYX, Exelixis considered these investments in expanding and improving our manufacturing capabilities and supply chain, as well as rising manufacturing costs.",,"It is Exelixis' stated mission to develop innovative, effective, tolerable and durable treatments for patients with cancer.  To accomplish this, Exelixis has and continues to increase our investments in innovative research and development activities.  In pre-clinical and clinical testing, cabozantinib has shown promising activity against many forms of cancer and Exelixis is therefore engaged in a very broad clinical development program aimed at improving cabozantinib by exploring the medicine's full therapeutic potential to help patients.
